# Online-Retail-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-with-Python

## Project Description: - 
This GitHub repository contains a comprehensive analysis of transactional data from an online retail store. The dataset provides detailed information about customer purchases, including product details, quantities, prices, and timestamps. The primary objective of this project is to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain valuable insights into the store's sales trends, customer behavior, and popular products.

### Key Features: - 
+ *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*: Utilizes various statistical and visualization techniques to identify patterns, outliers, and correlations within the dataset.
+ *Sales Trends Analysis*: Investigates the busiest sales months, trends over time, and seasonal variations to understand the store's sales patterns.
+ *Product Analysis*: Identifies the best-selling products and their performance over different periods.
+ *Customer Behavior Analysis*: Analyzes customer purchasing behavior, including frequency of purchases, average order value, and customer segmentation.
+ *Visualization*: Presents findings through informative and visually appealing plots, charts, and graphs for better interpretation.
+ *Python Code*: Includes Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks used for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.

By leveraging the power of data analysis and visualization techniques, this project aims to empower stakeholders with actionable insights to drive business growth and success in the competitive online retail market.

Important: - The code.md file includes both the code and several relevant graphs.
